# Maze Shooter Mini-Game
Maze Shooter is a single-player mini-game built in Unity where the player navigates a procedurally generated 3D maze and fights enemies. The game is based on our main game MazeMates. We've used the following scripts from our Game:
MazeGenerator3D and ResourcePlacement. 

## Gameplay

B. The enemy has a weapon too and shoots at the player


C. The player starts the game with 100 health points and loses points when the enemies hits him. If health = 0 then player loses.
